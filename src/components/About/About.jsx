        <p>
          I am currently pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science and
          Engineering, in St. Joseph College of Engineering, Sriperumbudur.
          <br />
          <br />
          I was introduced to web development since my high school vacation and
          I am fascinated by it ever since. It took me 3 years to have a solid
          knowledge in web development as an industry. I find the constant
          evolution of web development makes me to be updated and pushes me to
          level up my skills.
          <br />
          <br />
          I have no experience of working as a web developer intern; though I
          look forward to it. I have intermediate knowledge in languages such as
          Python, Java, C, C++ as they are taught along my journey.
          <br />
          <br />I believe my knowledge of web development is valuable. I develop
          my websites with consistent UI and build robust API as backend. I
          strongly enforce a11y (web accessibility) and Unit Testing in my
          workflow.
